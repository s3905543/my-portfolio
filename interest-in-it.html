									<p>
										<br> </br>
										<strong>What is your interest in IT? When did it start?</strong>
										<br> </br>
										My interest in IT is pretty boring. I just love working with IT. I love learning more and more about the operating systems that I am using or how the applications I am using every day, work and how to configure it myself. 
										
										Well I think that it all started when I was 5 years old. When I first logged in my password and username in the school computer. But my real interest in IT started when I started playing around with command prompt and making .bat files, or playing around with notepad and notepad++ and making HTML websites. 
										<br> </br>
										<strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</strong>
										<br> </br>
										If I had to say there was a particular person or event, it would have to be one of my old primary school teachers, Ms. Greenwood. In prep, I used to go to the computer labs and play club penguin on the computers. When the computer labs were full, I used to go around looking for free computers at classrooms. That’s how I met Ms. Greenwood. Ms. Greenwood was a substitute teacher for a Grade 7 class, back in the day when Grade 7 was in primary school. She was just such a nice, caring person that I would run to just to hang out. I remember one of the things she used to say to me, “Kobi, don’t ever let anyone tell you who you are. If you like playing on the computers, play on the computers.” At this time, I was being bullied by some older kids and I guess Ms. Greenwood was making me feel better. 
										She was honestly just a cool lady and I hope that to this day she is doing well and life is treating her good.
										
										My experience in IT is pretty limited. I’ve dabbled in HTML, javascript, CSS but mainly C++, using swift. I’ve played around with Lego Mindstorms and using the NXT platform. I have also messed with Raspberry Pi’s but very limited. I made a touch-screen mirror but that was with the help of a YouTube tutorial (which I have linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjPGoGmO5VY&ab_channel=WickedMakers">here</a>).
										<br> </br>
										<strong>Why did I choose RMIT?</strong>
										<br> </br>
										Well I didn’t really choose RMIT. I picked RMIT cause it was the only university that would take me in. I don’t have an ATAR score, due to a mixture of family drama and not trying my best in my final exams. I was the kid in Grade 12 who really did not care about my future. My life was a mess. I had been kicked out by my Dad, my Mum in Melbourne, nowhere to go. I was living by myself, renting a small apartment. Working 30 hours just so I could pay rent and eat. I was more invested in keeping myself alive than keeping my grades up. But then covid-19 hit and well, life took its turn. No job meant no house. I got on the doll like all my friends were and I still did not focus on my grades. In the end, I didn’t care about my schooling. If I had cared, I feel like I could of got a decent ATAR score and got into this course a lot easier. 
										<br> </br>
										<strong>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</strong>
										<br> </br>
										I try to not expect things, just in case I get hurt. If I had to expect anything, it would be that I learn the skills to be able to work in the IT industry and have basic skills to learn and improve from.
