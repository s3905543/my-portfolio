									<p>My idea is to create a touchscreen mirror that recognises you from face id and/or touch id. 
										It would be able to connect and control lights and other bluetooth connected devices using Google Home or Amazon Alexa. 
										This makes it easier for people who are disabled or have a disability.
										<br></br>
										The motivation behind this device is that I already have made a basic touchscreen mirror but there is definitely more room to improve. 
										Also, currently touchscreen mirrors that are in production and available to buy to the public are very expensive when the basic software needed for it is very cheap and could be sold to the target audience at a cheap price. 
										<strong>4 million Australians</strong>, or <strong>18% of the population</strong>, have a disability which means the demographic for this device is immense. This device would help people complete tasks that are a struggle for them, the tasks that we take for granted. 
										<br></br>
										With the use of raspberry pi technology, the uses of this software is enormous. We could keep it basic with showing a makeup video while you do your own makeup. 
										Or we could make it super advanced and have the mirror detect if you have fallen and alert an ambulance or a doctor or a family member/friend. 
										In my mind, I would have a basic model  be able to use Google Assistant/Amazon Alexa capabilities and be able to control music and volume, be able to turn lights off and on, and much, much more. 
										I’d have it be able to tell you the weather, tell you any meetings you had in the afternoon, remind you that you haven’t drunk enough water. I would have it remind me all the assignments that I have upcoming in Canvas. 
										If you want, I could develop it to present NASA’s image of the day, so even the astrologists can stay up to date. 
										Of course you can’t walk past the most important feature of a smart mirror, showing you your beautiful face! 
										Obviously it would use AndroidOS because of the Raspberry Pi but over a couple months (maybe a few years), I could create an AppleOS version of the software and use that connect to Apple HomePod or HomePod mini, which in turn would connect to iPhones and Apple Watches. 
										This would be able to create a more dynamic, seamless use of the technology and would open more possibilities. 
										I could create API’s and modules to connect to the health app and make health tracking much more accurate.
										<br></br>
										To make this ‘smart’ mirror, I’ll need basic woodworking tools: drill, saw, file, chisel, tape measure, levels, hammers, squares, wood working pencils and wood glue. 
										I will also need basic softwaring tools: mouse and keyboard, Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, Raspberry Pi case, micro to HDMI cord, usb c cable, monitor, two way mirror, IR touch panel or touch foil. 
										For software, open source projects like <a href="https://docs.magicmirror.builders/">MagicMirror2</a> and <a href="https://forum.magicmirror.builders/topic/8481/mmm-iframe-ping">this module</a> for video playing. 
										If I was to create a mirror that did detect if you or someone else fell, I would create a config file that allowed to do that. For that to work, I would have to add sensors or a camera that is constantly processing data to recognise the falling motion.
										<br></br>
										Skills required would be basic woodworking skills. Having a trade based family, I feel like I could build the base of the mirror with just my experience.
										The use of already made, open-source software for the raspberry does take some time away as well. 
										More skills needed would probably be coding using Python, which I do not have experience using. 
										This would be only if original software was needed to be made. It is pretty basic so a lot of skill is not required for this project. 
										<br></br>
										If this project was to become an everyday, every household item, the need for fall detection equipment, like watches, would become unnecessary and the future of connectivity would be accelerated. 
										<strong>223,000</strong> were hospitalised due to unintentional falls, which contributed to <strong>5,100 deaths</strong> in the health system. With this device, it could lower these numbers. Maybe even to zero.
