										<h2> <strong>Myer-Briggs Test</strong></h2>
										<p>
											These results, explain some of my actions a lot better than I would be able to.
											The results say I am ‘Turbulent Logician’ which means that I am abstract thinking and very enthusiastic with new ideas. 
											According to the results, I am also very private and withdrawn and can be very insensitive at times, both these aspects I do see in my everyday actions and my thoughts.  
											After seeing these results, I definitely believe that I will watch my behaviour when working in teams. 
											I can’t, as a logician, over correct someone and I cannot withdraw from a project.I will also watch who I pick if I do get to pick a team.
											As a turbulent logician, I would not pick another logician as they do not work well together as they want to work alone. I would want to work with an architect.

										<h2> <strong>Learning Style Test</strong></h2>
										<p>
											This result shows how I learn. It helps my understanding grow and how I can further develop and better my learning style. 
											Also shows how I can better my learning in full. I think this result will make me watch my behaviour more when working in a group. 
											I feel like I will listen more as I do seem to learn more from listening. If I catch myself humming to myself or bouncing my knee, I’ll know to refocus on the task in front of me. 
											If I was making a team, I’d try to get more people who tactile learners and people who are more inclined to talk what they have learnt to better myself.

										<h2> <strong>Big Five Personality Test</strong></h2>
										<p>
											These results confer with the 2 previous tests. They agree that I am a private, withdrawn person. These results really hammers the nail in the coffin. 
											They show that I am in the lower percentile for conscientiousness and intellect/imagination. They also show that I am high-scoring for agreeableness. 
											All of these result indicate that yes I am a turbulent logician, someone who is happy to agree to stop any conflict and that I am very distant with peers. 
											This gives me something to work on. I do not want to just agree to stop any chance of conflict. I will try and push my ideas more forward. With making groups, I would not get more people who are like me but opposites. 
											So we can move forward with ideas, that are good. 
											If I have a group that are full of turbulent logicians, we would all agree and potentially put forth a bad project/assignment because we were too scared of conflict.
